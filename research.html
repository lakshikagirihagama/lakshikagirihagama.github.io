<h3>Current research</h3>
		<p>My current research, in a broad sense, include understanding of large lake circulation and water quality modelling. I work with scientists from the University of Toronto and the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change to characterize and help interpret water circulation as it underpins water quality gradients in the coastal zone of the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, Ontario. Using detailed sets of concurrent physical and chemical field observations from the eastern shore of the 15,000 km2 Georgian Bay. Application of interpretative and predictive models will be used to understand the exchange of nutrients and water quality more generally from rivers to the main body of the lake through the complex archipelago of over 30,000 islands. This analysis of key circulation features to be developed is needed to support environmental management in this complex coastline where the ultra-oligotrophic waters of Lake Huron dilute embayments and channels feed by comparatively nutrient-rich and chemically dissimilar waters draining the Canadian Shield.</p>
